  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm an IT Cloud and Virtualization Infrastructure/Systems/DevOps Engineer trying to learn some Web Development so I can build my own web site. During my free time I enjoy the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Travel</li>
      <li>Scuba Diving</li>
      <li>Photography</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>The web site I'm working to develop is to show off the results of my free time and maybe even make some money to help pay for it. You can see some of the results <a href="https://twogeckosphotography.com">here</a>.</p>
